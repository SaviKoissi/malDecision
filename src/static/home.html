  <p class="lead">A tool for data-driven decision-making to manage infectious diseases in environments with varying levels of urbanization.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>malDecision used a machine learning method to prioritize the determinants. This tool helps visualize the spatial distribution of the region of interest and the hierarchy of the determinant post-analysis.  Moreover, the user can download a custom report that could guide him in making informed decisions based on the disease trajectory.</p>
  <p>The flexible and interactive malDecision tool was created to assist practitioners and decision-makers in adopting a data-driven strategy for the control of infectious diseases in their countries.</p>
  <p>This tool is outlined in the peer-reviewed publication available.</p>
